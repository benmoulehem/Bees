🐝Bee Project

This project focuses on leveraging AI and machine learning techniques to support bee research and conservation. It includes two main components:

Pollen Detection 🌼
Developed a computer vision model to detect and analyze pollen on bees, helping to monitor pollination activity and understand ecological patterns.

Bee-eater Sound Detection 🎶
Built an audio classification system to identify bee-eater bird sounds, which are a natural predator of bees. This can be used to assess environmental threats and support conservation strategies.

The project combines image processing and audio analysis to provide valuable insights into pollinator health and ecosystem dynamics.
